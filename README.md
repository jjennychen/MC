v2:
- basic encoder/decoder
- interactive arrangement(choose between encoder, decoder, and main page)
- user can decide whether or not to continue converting or to end program

v3:
- basic encoder/decoder
- interactive arrangement(choose between encoder, decoder, and main page)
- user can decide whether or not to continue converting or to end program
- read text files and output files
// ascii.txt and morse_code.txt can be used for testing
